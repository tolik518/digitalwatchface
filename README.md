# digitalwatchface
Just a basic huawei watchface for the huawei watch GT. Inspired by my old casio watch

The watchface sadly didn't come out as I planned because the options for the huawei watch GT are
very limited. This is how the watchface was planned:

This is how it turned out.

I think it still looks pretty neat. For that oldschool digital segment display look I added 
some shadowing which turned out rather nice. The frustrating thing is that it's not possible
to use that digital font for the heartrate and for the battery percentage since there is no 
"SelImage" for these indicators. The only way to add them is via "Changing Text", which won't
allow us to use a custom font.
